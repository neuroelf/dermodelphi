        Our aim is to label each of
        the <a href={"https://isic-archive.com/"} target={"_blank"}>ISIC
        Archive</a> images with the <b>{DC.TITLE_TXT_DIAG + " "}
        ({DC.TITLE_TXT_MINI})</b> that most <u>accurately and
        reproducibly</u> represents the histopathological diagnosis.
    </p>
    <p className="delphi-general-text-paragraph">
        We all know that at present, the same lesion may be given variable
        names, depending on the clinician or pathologist diagnosing the
        lesion. However, for the ISIC Archive to be a useful database, we
        need to converge on agreed-upon diagnostic labels (i.e., a unique
        {" " + DC.TITLE_TXT_MINI}) for each type of lesion.
    </p>
    <p className="delphi-general-text-paragraph">
        We need your help to reach an agreement on
        the {DC.TITLE_TXT_MINI} working list!
    </p>
    <p className="delphi-general-text-paragraph">
        Our overarching hope is that in generating this consensus list of
        diagnoses, we can contribute to the greater dermatology
        community â€“ by creating accepted diagnostic standards.
    </p>
    <p className="delphi-general-text-paragraph">
        As part of this survey, you will see a list of {DC.TITLE_TXT_MINI + " "}
        terms, which are grouped under categories (e.g., type of
        proliferation) and under super-categories (e.g., "Benign" and
        "Malignant"). The {DC.TITLE_TXT_MINI} terms will be presented as
        blocks / clusters to simplify viewing and editing of the terms.
